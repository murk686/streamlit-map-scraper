2. Data Display: View fetched business data (name, address) in a table.

3. Export Options: Download results as CSV or Excel files.

4. Static Map View: Display a static map of the searched location using the Google Maps Static API.

5. Search History: View recent searches in a sidebar, with options to clear history or export it as CSV.

6. Theme Toggle: Switch between light and dark themes for better usability.
